This is my first python project uploaded to GitHub. It is a hash checker. 
1. Simply copy and paste the hashes to their proper inputs and click the "check" button. 
2. This will compare the two hashes and output what hashing algorithm was used. 
3. Click on the "differences" button for a string where every changed character in the hash is highligted.
